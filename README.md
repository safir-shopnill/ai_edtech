This project is part of my internship at the MoneyHub. 
The goal was to create a wrapper webpage using OpenAI's API to give high school students a catalyst for thinking about their career choices. 
Users input their interests and skills to which they recieve three prospective careers and a tip about them.
They can then choose one of the three careers to receive more information on it such as median salary, education track, and career trajectory.
